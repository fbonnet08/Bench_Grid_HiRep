# The underlining sampling algorithm

# LLR class to define

- routine to call the different replicas
- Algorithm that update the sysrtg within the energy interval
- updates within the energy intervals can be:
  - PHB, --> shapr boundary
  - HMC -- > define a gaussian 2 parameters
  - ---> aim to compute the expected energy

# Configuration update
# LLR HMC controller instantiated from the the LLR class
# Try to understand the
